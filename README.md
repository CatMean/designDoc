# Design Doc

A product design process in github markdown that enables cross-functional teams to take an idea from napkin to scale by prioritizing learnings to produce customer-centered solutions.

## Usage

### First choose a workflow

Decide whether you want to work in the [source files](https://github.com/ryanallen/designDoc/tree/main/docs), which let you use [node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), and [docbits](https://github.com/ryanallen/docbits) to keep your design doc [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) and maintainable...  

or the [distribution docs](https://github.com/ryanallen/designDoc/tree/main/dist/docs) which are built from the source docs and don't require a [software build process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_build).

### Then get the design docs

Make a copy of this design doc repository by clicking the fork button in the top right of the page, or manually save the files you need from this repo. Don't forget to hit that ‚≠ê button <3.

### Finally, design!

Start with [discovery](/dist/docs/discovery.md),  
then [exploration](/dist/docs/exploration.md),  
then [go to market](/dist/docs/goToMarket.md),  
and finally share out the [summarized learnings](/dist/docs/designDoc.md).
